## What is Amethyst?
Amethyst is a free [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) alternative that is derived from two existing projects, [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

The purpose of Amethyst is to provide a space to publish more structured notes created in Obsidian that may not fit in the [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/) archetype that is well-supported by existing projects.

## Purpose of this website
This website is a clone of the original Amethyst theme, developed for the TECAA curricular unit of the Masters in Informatics Engineering at ISEP, Porto, Portugal.

It's purpose is to teach you to develop technical documentation websites using Hugo static pages, and more specifically using the Amethyst theme.

### Group Decisions
- Decided to use the Amethyst theme (reasons detailed in our BitBucket, in [our Group Report](https://bitbucket.org/mei-isep/tecaa_2023_3/src/main/Part1/documentation/group/GroupReport.md)).
- Decided to not change fonts or styles, to abide by the chosen theme's pallete and feel.
- Followed WCAG accessibility guidelines to keep the website accessible.
- Followed Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines to keep the website coherent in terms of structure and tone of voice.
- Decided to use the Expand feature to partially hide, and thus better organize, the "How this page was made" sections (Individual decisions for each page) and this "How this website was made" section.

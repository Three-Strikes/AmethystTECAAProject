## Getting Started

### Installing Hugo
* First, you will need to ensure that your system meets the requirements for running Hugo projects. You can install Hugo using one of the following methods:
{{< tabs "preview" >}}
{{< tab "Installing via Package Manager" >}} 
- [macOS (Homebrew)](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/):
  ```bash
  brew install hugo 
  ```
- [Windows (Chocolatey](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/):
  ```bash
  choco install hugo -confirm
  ```
- [Linux (apt-get)](https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install hugo
  ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Installing from Binary" >}} 
Alternatively, you can download the appropriate binary for your operating system from the [Hugo releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and add it to your system's PATH. <br>
> Please consult your operating system documentation if you need help setting file permissions or modifying your PATH environment variable.

* Once installed, verify the installation by running:
```bash
hugo version
```
### Setting up a new Hugo Site with the Amethyst theme
Setting up an Amethyst project requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!

#### 1. Forking
> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

* Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Amethyst project:

[Amethyst Repository](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst)

* Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

*Create a new fork repository menu*

#### 2. Cloning
> Cloning a repository involves creating a local copy of an online repository onto your own machine. This process allows you to work with the repository's files and history directly on your local system. <br>
> Cloning is particularly useful for collaborating on projects, as it enables contributors to make changes, experiment, and contribute back to the original project without altering the master copy.

* After you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. 

{{< tabs "cloning" >}}
{{< tab "Clone using the web URL" >}}
First, ensure that you have `git` installed in your machine (if you don't know how to do this, check this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)). <br>
Then, type the following command into the command line interpreter located in your desired directory, replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/amethyst.git
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Clone using the GitHub desktop app">}}
GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly interface for managing your Git repositories. Follow these steps to clone a repository using GitHub Desktop:

1. **Download GitHub Desktop:**
If you haven't already, download and install the GitHub Desktop app from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. **Launch GitHub Desktop and sign in to your GitHub account**
3. **Clone the Repository:**
* Click the button to start the cloning process.

*Location of the clone button for the forked repository*
![Cloning the forked Amethyst repository](/images/github_clone_forked_2.png)
*Location of the clone button for the forked repository via the GitHub Desktop app*
* In the GitHub Desktop, select the local path where you want the repository to be downloaded. GitHub Desktop will then complete the cloning process for you.

#### 3. Open the Cloned Repository
* Once the cloning process is complete, you can open the repository and start working with its files, in your preferred code editor (for example, the [Visual Studio Code software](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

{{< expand "How this page was made">}}
#### Page author
This page was created by Pedro Paulo (NÂº 1220496), a Master Student in Informatics Engineering at ISEP, Porto, Portugal.
This website was a project created for the TECAA course unit.

#### Development process
This page aims to guide users through the setup process of a Hugo website featuring the Amethyst theme. The content in this web page is a summarized version of the steps outlined in the [Setup](https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/setup/) page of the official Amethyst documentation, supplemented with additional relevant information to serve the intended purpose effectively.

A summary of the individual decisions used in this page, is presented bellow:

{{< tabs "feature-summary" >}}
{{< tab "Text, headings and links" >}} 

#### Text

_No individual decisions were made._
<br>
Following group decisions: 

* No style or font changes were made to the text, so that the page follows the base Amethyst theme.
* The content was written following the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines' Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights). 

#### Headings

_No individual decisions were made._
<br>
Special attention was given so that:

* Headings level follow a correct hierarchy, as per the [WCAG accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
* Heading titles are written with Sentence Case, as per the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines' Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)

#### Links

**Individual decision:** Links to other pages are conveyed solely by using the simple Markdown links.<br>
Group decisions regarding links were followed.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Callouts" >}} 

#### Callouts

**Individual decision:** Foldable Callouts were used to give the reader additional informations whenever necessary, as their colorful styles are a very effective way to pull the user's attention.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Columns" >}} 

#### Columns
**Individual decision:** The Columns feature, provided by the Amethyst theme, was used in this page to succinctly present essential information. The primary objective behind this choice is to condense the length of the section, as it mainly covers introductory topics that are auxillary to the purpose of the page. By structuring the content in columns, we aim to streamline the reading experience for users, allowing them to quickly grasp the key points without being overwhelmed by excessive detail.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Tabs" >}} 

#### Tabs

**Individual decision:** The Tabs feature was implemented to present two distinct sets of alternative steps for users, offering options for both the installation of Hugo and the download of the Amethyst project. This use of tabs effectively communicates to users that they need only select one of the provided options, rather than following both simultaneously. 
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Expand" >}} 

#### Expand

_No individual decisions were made._<br>
As defined in the group decisions, The Expand feature was used to write this very section on "How the page was made". Expand creates a collapsible area of text, perfect to hide these implementation details that are not part of the main page's content.

## Overview
In an Amethyst website, every page is also called a **note**. <br>
Each note is controlled by a single [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file. To personalize the content of your website, you can add, edit, or delete the respective files. 


> [!warning]- Do not edit the HTML code
> 
> Amethyst runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), removing the need to know how to operate in HTML to create your static pages. <br>
> Thus, it is not advisable to edit these files directly. They are generated by Hugo based on the Markdown files, so your manual changes can be lost.


<br>


## Previewing the website

Before you add and edit content on your new website, it is best to run the website so that you can see its current state. By leaving the website running, you can also check the result of your changes in real time. <br><br>
The way to do it changes depending on if you want to [integrate Obsidian Vaults](./obsidian.md) in your website or not.

{{< tabs "preview" >}}
{{< tab "Default Amethyst" >}} 
If you have no need for Obsidian Vaults integration, follow this steps:
1. In your computer, open a terminal (like CMD or PowerShell)
2. Navigate to your website's folder
3. Execute the following command: 
```bash
# Tell Hugo to create a server for your website to run
hugo server
```
4. You are now hosting (running) your website locally in your computer. See here [your locally hosted website](http://localhost:1313/), or paste ```http://localhost:1313/``` in your internet browser.

{{< tab "With Obsidian Vaults" >}} 
When using Obsidian Vaults, the process becomes more complex, and you need to install some dependencies.

* To ensure you get the most up-to-date information, we recommend you to follow the steps documented in the official [Amethyst webpage](https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/preview-changes/) about previewing changes.

## Creating and editing notes

Now that your website is running, it is time to edit your notes. <br>
Since Markdown is just a way to create formatted text, you can use any text or code editor.

> [!note]- Do not have an editor? 
> 
>  Try out [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a lightweight editor that also includes a helpful [extension to write Markdown files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one). 


### Folder structure

All notes and images of your website go in the ```/content``` folder. <br> 
You can create as many subfolders as you need, and the path of folders to reach your note will show in the link of the note on your browser.

So, for example, the link ```http://localhost:1313/setup/config/``` tells your website to fetch and show the note ```config.md``` located inside the ```setup``` folder, as shown in the images below.


{{< columns >}} <!-- begin columns block -->
**```/content``` folder location**
![Content folder location](/images/content-folder.png)

<---> <!-- magic separator, between columns -->

**Path to reach ```config.md```**
![Path to reach config.md](/images/example-of-note.png)
{{< /columns >}}


### Setting up the front matter

The most important part of a note in Amethyst (and Hugo in general) is its front matter. <br>
The front matter is a group of settings, surrounded by ```---```, that you must define at the start of your note so that Hugo considers it a valid page. However, you do not need to specify all of them.
<br><br>
The most commonly used settings include the note's title and tags, if it is visible on the Table of Contents (ToC) present on the website's left-side pane, and its weight on the ToC (its order in relation to other notes).
```yaml
---
# Set the title of the note
title: "Example title"

# Set the tags of the note
tags:
- example-tag

# Set to true to hide the note from the Table of Contents
bookHidden: false

# Set to order this note in relation to other notes on the Table of Contents (higher numbers make it go down on the list)
weight: 2
---

Rest of your content here...
```

> [!note]- Additional front matter settings
>
> These are other settings that you can add to the front matter section of your note, for it to further suit your needs.
> ```yaml
> # Set type to 'docs' if you want to render page outside of configured section or if you render section other than 'docs'
> type: 'docs'
> 
> # (Optional) Set to 'true' to mark page as flat section in file-tree menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
> bookFlatSection: false
> 
> # (Optional) Set to hide nested sections or pages at that level. Works only with file-tree menu mode
> bookCollapseSection: true
> 
> # (Optional) Set 'false' to hide ToC from page
> bookToC: true
> 
> # (Optional) If you have enabled BookComments for the site, you can disable it for specific pages.
> bookComments: true
> 
> # (Optional) Set to 'false' to exclude page from search index.
> bookSearchExclude: true
> 
> # (Optional) Set explicit href attribute for this page in a menu (if BookMenuBundle not set)
> bookHref: ''
>
> ```


### Writing content

With your note settings ready, you can now start writing the content you need. <br><br>

Since Amethyst notes are written in Markdown files, you can take advantage of all [Markdown features and syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), such as lists, tables, and links to better organize your content. <br><br>

In addition, there are some [Amethyst exclusive features](https://amethyst.bencuan.me/features/buttons/), such as buttons, columns, tabs, and callouts that you can explore to give some more customization to your webpage.


<br>

{{< expand "How this page was made">}}
#### Page author
This page was created by Rafael Martins (NÂº 1180887), a Master Student in Informatics Engineering at ISEP, Porto, Portugal.
This website was a project created for the TECAA course unit.

#### Development process
This page teaches how to edit and preview content in the Amethyst Hugo theme. To do so, its content was written by reorganizing and summarizing the [Editing Content](https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/editing/) and [Preview Changes](https://amethyst.bencuan.me/setup/preview-changes/) pages of the official Amethyst documentation. 

The page was developed by following the instructions that it teaches, that is:

1. Created a new Markdown file ```editingcontent.md``` inside the folder ```/content/tecaa/```.
2. Set up the front matter settings: the title of the page and the the weight (order) in relation to other pages in the same folder.
3. Added the content necessary.
4. Organized the page using various Markdown and Amethyst features, while make sure it abides by the [defined group decisions]().

Below is a summary of the individual decisions used in this page, regarding each feature.

{{< tabs "feature-summary" >}}
{{< tab "Text, headings and links" >}} 

#### Text

_No individual decisions needed to be made in relation to the text._
<br>
Following group decisions: 

* No style or font changes were made to the text, so that the page follows the base Amethyst theme.
* The content was written following the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines' Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights). 

#### Headings

_No individual decisions were made._
<br>
Special attention was given so that:

* Headings level follow a correct hierarchy, as per the [WCAG accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
* Heading titles are written with Sentence Case, as per the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines' Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)

#### Links

**Individual decision:** Do not use the styled buttons provided by Amethyst to provide links.<br>

* **Reason:** These buttons are designed to be a more appelative way to show links to the user. However, buttons can also be used to trigger various actions in dynamic websites, instead of being links to other pages. These two distinct usages of buttons may create confusion to the reader, so it was decided that links to other pages are conveyed solely by using the simple Markdown links.

Group decisions regarding links were followed.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Callouts" >}} 

#### Callouts

**Individual decision:** Foldable Callouts were used to give the reader additional warnings or recommendations whenever necessary, as their colorful styles are a very effective way to pull the user's attention. All three callouts start out closed:

* The warning callout starts closed so that all emphasis is given to the warning title. Afterwards, if the user wants to understand the warning, they can open the callout.
* The two additional content callouts start closed due to their optional nature. Being closed, they do not clutter the page's content, and the user can still open them and read the contents if interested.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Columns" >}} 

#### Columns
**Individual decision:** The Columns feature, provided by the Amethyst theme, was used in this page to display to the reader two images side by side. 

* **Reason:** The paths descriptions in the **Folder Structure** instructions section may be difficult to understand at first for a less experinced user. To mitigate this, the objective was to present the reader with two images that together show the structure of an Amethyst Hugo project. As such, the Columns feature that allows the user to visualize both images side by side and compare both was considered to be an ideal solution.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Tabs" >}} 

#### Tabs

**Individual decision:** The Tabs feature was used to show two sets of alternative steps that the user can follow to preview their changes, depending on their decision to integrate Amethyst with Obsidian Vaults or not. 

* **Reason:** This is a typical use case for tabs, since it conveys to the user that they just have to choose one of the options, not follow both.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Expand" >}} 

#### Expand

_No individual decisions were made._<br>
As defined in the group decisions, The Expand feature was used to write this very section on "How the page was made". Expand creates a collapsible area of text, perfect to hide these implementation details that are not part of the main page's content.
